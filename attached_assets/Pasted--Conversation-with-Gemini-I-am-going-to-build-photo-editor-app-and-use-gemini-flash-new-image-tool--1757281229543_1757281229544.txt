I am going to build photo editor app and use gemini flash(new image tool)



how can use free api key




Show thinking
Building a photo editor app with Gemini Flash is a great idea. The good news is that you can get started for free. Google offers a free tier for the Gemini API, including Gemini Flash.

Here's a breakdown of how to get a free API key and what the free tier entails:

How to Get a Free API Key
Go to Google AI Studio: The main platform for obtaining a free API key for the Gemini API is Google AI Studio. You'll need to sign in with your Google account.


Navigate to the API key section: Once you're logged in, look for a button or menu option to "Get API key." The location might vary slightly as the UI evolves, but it's typically in a prominent place like the top-left corner or a settings menu.

Create a new API key: Follow the prompts to create a new API key for a new or existing project. Google AI Studio will generate a unique string of characters.

Save your key securely: This is crucial. Your API key acts like a password. Do not hard-code it directly into your app's public-facing code (e.g., a client-side web app) or check it into source control. A best practice is to use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.


The Free Tier for Gemini Flash
Google provides a "free tier" for the Gemini API, which is different from a free trial with a time limit. It's a perpetual free-of-charge tier with specific usage limits designed for development and testing.


Here are some key points about the free tier for Gemini Flash:

Rate Limits: The free tier comes with specific rate limits, such as a maximum number of requests per minute (RPM), tokens per minute (TPM), and requests per day (RPD). These limits are generous for getting started but are not intended for large-scale production use. For example, for Gemini 2.5 Flash, the free tier limits might be around 10 RPM and 250 RPD.


Pricing: Within the free tier, input and output prices for models like Gemini Flash are free of charge. You will only be billed if you enable a paid tier and exceed the free usage limits.

Data Usage: One important thing to note about the free tier is that your data (prompts and outputs) may be used to improve Google's products. If you enable the paid tier, this data is not used for product improvement.

Upgrading: If your app grows and you need higher rate limits or more features, you can easily upgrade to a paid tier by enabling billing for your Google Cloud project. This allows you to scale your usage and access additional features.


In summary, you can absolutely use a free API key to build your photo editor app with Gemini Flash. Start by getting your key from Google AI Studio, and be mindful of the free tier's usage limits as you develop and test your application.






I mean the image editing api



Show thinking
You can absolutely use the Gemini Flash image editing API for free. The free tier is designed for developers and testing, giving you the ability to build and test your app without any cost.


How to get a free API key
Google AI Studio: The main way to get started is by going to Google AI Studio. You'll need to sign in with your Google account.

Generate a Key: Once inside, you'll find an option to "Get API key." Follow the steps to create a new key.

Secure Your Key: It's critical to treat your API key like a password. Do not embed it directly into your client-side code. Instead, use secure methods like environment variables or a server-side backend to make API calls. This prevents others from using your key and potentially incurring charges.

Free Tier Details for Image Editing
The free tier for the Gemini API, including Gemini Flash, has specific usage limits, which are more than enough for development.

Usage Limits: The free tier for models like Gemini 2.5 Flash has a daily request limit. For example, you may be able to generate or edit up to 100 images per day at no cost. These limits are subject to change, so always check the official documentation.


Pricing: Within the free tier, input and output for image generation and editing are free of charge. You'll only be billed if you upgrade to a paid tier and exceed the free usage limits.

Data Handling: With the free tier, your data may be used to improve Google's products. If you enable a paid tier, this data is not used for product improvement.

In essence, you can build and prototype your photo editor app using the free API key and the generous free tier limits. This allows you to test out features like:

Prompt-based image editing (e.g., "remove this person," "change the background").

Multi-image fusion (combining elements from multiple photos).

Character consistency (maintaining a subject's look across different edits).

This video provides a practical example of how to use the Gemini API in a Python project to create an image generation app.

what is the sample python code for image generating


Here is a sample Python code for generating an image using a Gemini model, specifically the gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model, which is optimized for this task.

This example uses the official google-genai Python library.

Prerequisites
Install the library: Make sure you have the library installed. If not, run the following command:

Bash

pip install google-genai
Get an API Key: You'll need a free API key from Google AI Studio. Set it as an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY. This is the most secure way to use your key without hardcoding it.

Python Code for Image Generation
The code below sends a text prompt to the Gemini API and saves the generated image. It also includes the necessary imports for handling image data.

Python

import os
import io
from PIL import Image

from google import genai

# Configure the API key.
# It's recommended to set this as an environment variable.
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])

# The model name for image generation.
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview"

# The text prompt describing the image you want to generate.
prompt = "A high-quality, professional photo of a futuristic kitchen with holographic recipe displays, a sleek, minimalist design, and a robot chef."

# Create a Gemini client.
client = genai.Client()

try:
    # Send the prompt to the model to generate the content.
    response = client.generate_content(
        model=MODEL_NAME,
        contents=[prompt]
    )

    # The response will contain an image part.
    # Loop through the parts to find and save the image.
    for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
        # Check if the part contains image data.
        if part.inline_data is not None:
            # Use the PIL library to open the image from bytes.
            image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(part.inline_data.data))
            # Save the image to a file.
            image.save("generated_futuristic_kitchen.png")
            print("Image generated successfully and saved as 'generated_futuristic_kitchen.png'.")
            
        elif part.text is not None:
            # If the response includes text, print it.
            print("Model response:", part.text)
            
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")







do you really provide api for image editing in gemini flash banana image editing


Yes, Gemini provides an API for image editing through the gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model, which is also known by its code name, "Nano Banana." This model isn't just for generating new images from text; it also allows for a range of powerful editing capabilities.


Key Image Editing Capabilities
The Gemini Flash image model goes beyond basic edits and offers advanced features that you can leverage for your app:

Prompt-based Editing: You can make precise, targeted changes to an image using simple natural language prompts. For example, you can tell the model to "change the background to a beach" or "remove the person on the left."


Multi-turn Editing (Conversational): This allows for an iterative process. You can upload an image, ask the model to make a change, and then provide follow-up instructions to further refine the output in a conversational way. For example, "turn the car into a convertible," and then, "now change the color to red."

Multi-image Fusion: This capability allows you to combine elements from multiple images into a new, single image. You can use it to place a product into a different scene or blend textures from one image onto an object in another.
